# Space Launch LDJAM 42

## What

Decided to try enter the [Ludum Dare](https://ldjam.com/) game jame. Here is my entry.
Build a game in 48 or 72 hours. 

Didn't quite get done what I wanted. But learnt some new Phaser js skills. 

Could upload my entry, because ldjam website seemed to be struggling with load. Should do it earlier next time.

## Play
