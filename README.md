# Space Launch LDJAM 42

## What

Decided to try enter the [Ludum Dare](https://ldjam.com/) game jam. Here is my entry.

Didn't quite get done what I wanted. But learnt some new Phaser js skills. 

Couldn't upload my entry, because the ldjam website seemed to be struggling with load. Should do it earlier next time.

## Play 

A simple game where you try launch some satellites. The more you launch the more the space runs out. I really wish I could get more done.
